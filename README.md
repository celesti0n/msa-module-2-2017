# MSA Module 2 2017 Submission - Marcus Wong

  - 'Dog or Cat' - uses Microsoft's Custom Vision API with trained photos of dogs and cats to correctly predict whether a photo taken is a dog or a cat.
  - Integrated use of the in-built Camera apps on iOS and Android to take the photo
  - Use of Easy Tables to store location of photo capture, as well as Geolocator to convert latitude/longitude co-ordinates to a named location
  - Tested on a Nexus 6 running Nougat

# How to Use

  - Open up the application on your target device
  - On the first tab, tap 'Take photo to analyse' and take your photo
  - A prompt indicating loading will display along with your uploaded image. You can scroll down if your screen size cannot show the whole image.
  - The app will tell you how certain it is (from 0 to 100%) that it is a dog or a cat (or neither).
  - The second tab displays all the places photos have been taken. Posting a location is done automatically alongside Custom Vision analysis.
